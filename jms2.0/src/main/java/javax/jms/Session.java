/** <P>A <CODE>Session</CODE> object is a single-threaded context for producing and consuming 
  * messages. Although it may allocate provider resources outside the Java 
  * virtual machine (JVM), it is considered a lightweight JMS object.
  *
  * <P>A session serves several purposes:
  *
  * <UL>
  *   <LI>It is a factory for its message producers and consumers.
  *   <LI>It supplies provider-optimized message factories.
  *   <LI>It is a factory for <CODE>TemporaryTopics</CODE> and 
  *        <CODE>TemporaryQueues</CODE>. 
  *   <LI> It provides a way to create <CODE>Queue</CODE> or <CODE>Topic</CODE>
  *      objects for those clients that need to dynamically manipulate 
  *      provider-specific destination names.
  *   <LI>It supports a single series of transactions that combine work 
  *       spanning its producers and consumers into atomic units.
  *   <LI>It defines a serial order for the messages it consumes and 
  *       the messages it produces.
  *   <LI>It retains messages it consumes until they have been 
  *       acknowledged.
  *   <LI>It serializes execution of message listeners registered with 
  *       its message consumers.
  *   <LI> It is a factory for <CODE>QueueBrowsers</CODE>.
  * </UL>
  *
  * <P>A session can create and service multiple message producers and 
  * consumers.
  *
  * <P>One typical use is to have a thread block on a synchronous 
  * <CODE>MessageConsumer</CODE> until a message arrives. The thread may then
  * use one or more of the <CODE>Session</CODE>'s <CODE>MessageProducer</CODE>s.
  *
  * <P>If a client desires to have one thread produce messages while others 
  * consume them, the client should use a separate session for its producing 
  * thread.
  *
  * <P>Once a connection has been started, any session with one or more 
  * registered message listeners is dedicated to the thread of control that 
  * delivers messages to it. It is erroneous for client code to use this session
  * or any of its constituent objects from another thread of control. The
  * only exception to this rule is the use of the session or connection 
  * <CODE>close</CODE> method.
  *
  * <P>It should be easy for most clients to partition their work naturally
  * into sessions. This model allows clients to start simply and incrementally
  * add message processing complexity as their need for concurrency grows.
  *
  * <P>The <CODE>close</CODE> method is the only session method that can be 
  * called while some other session method is being executed in another thread.
  *
  * <P>A session may be specified as transacted. Each transacted 
  * session supports a single series of transactions. Each transaction groups 
  * a set of message sends and a set of message receives into an atomic unit 
  * of work. In effect, transactions organize a session's input message 
  * stream and output message stream into series of atomic units. When a 
  * transaction commits, its atomic unit of input is acknowledged and its 
  * associated atomic unit of output is sent. If a transaction rollback is 
  * done, the transaction's sent messages are destroyed and the session's input 
  * is automatically recovered.
  *
  * <P>The content of a transaction's input and output units is simply those 
  * messages that have been produced and consumed within the session's current 
  * transaction.
  *
  * <P>A transaction is completed using either its session's <CODE>commit</CODE>
  * method or its session's <CODE>rollback</CODE> method. The completion of a
  * session's current transaction automatically begins the next. The result is
  * that a transacted session always has a current transaction within which its 
  * work is done.  
  *
  * <P>The Java Transaction Service (JTS) or some other transaction monitor may 
  * be used to combine a session's transaction with transactions on other 
  * resources (databases, other JMS sessions, etc.). Since Java distributed 
  * transactions are controlled via the Java Transaction API (JTA), use of the 
  * session's <CODE>commit</CODE> and <CODE>rollback</CODE> methods in 
  * this context is prohibited.
  *
  * <P>The JMS API does not require support for JTA; however, it does define 
  * how a provider supplies this support.
  *
  * <P>Although it is also possible for a JMS client to handle distributed 
  * transactions directly, it is unlikely that many JMS clients will do this.
  * Support for JTA in the JMS API is targeted at systems vendors who will be 
  * integrating the JMS API into their application server products.
