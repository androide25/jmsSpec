/**
 * A <code>JMSContext</code> is the main interface in the simplified JMS API
 * introduced for JMS 2.0. This combines in a single object the functionality of
 * two separate objects from the JMS 1.1 API: a <code>Connection</code> and a
 * <code>Session</code>.
 * <p>
 * When an application needs to send messages it use the
 * <code>createProducer</code> method to create a <code>JMSProducer</code> which
 * provides methods to configure and send messages. Messages may be sent either
 * synchronously or asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * When an application needs to receive messages it uses one of several
 * <code>createConsumer</code> or <code>createDurableConsumer</code> methods to
 * create a <code>JMSConsumer</code> . A <code>JMSConsumer</code> provides
 * methods to receive messages either synchronously or asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * In terms of the JMS 1.1 API a <code>JMSContext</code> should be thought of as
 * representing both a <code>Connection</code> and a <code>Session</code>.
 * Although the simplified API removes the need for applications to use those
 * objects, the concepts of connection and session remain important. A
 * connection represents a physical link to the JMS server and a session
 * represents a single-threaded context for sending and receiving messages.
 * <p>
 * A <code>JMSContext</code> may be created by calling one of several
 * <code>createContext</code> methods on a <code>ConnectionFactory</code>. A
 * <code>JMSContext</code> that is created in this way is described as being
 * <i>application-managed</i>. An application-managed <code>JMSContext</code>
 * must be closed when no longer needed by calling its <code>close</code>
 * method.
 * <p>
 * Applications running in the Java EE web and EJB containers may alternatively
 * inject a <code>JMSContext</code> into their application using the
 * <code>@Inject</code> annotation. A <code>JMSContext</code> that is created in
 * this way is described as being <i>container-managed</i>. An
 * application-managed <code>JMSContext</code> will be closed automatically by
 * the container. Applications must not call its <code>close</code> method.
 * <p>
 * Applications running in the Java EE web and EJB containers are not permitted
 * to create more than one active session on a connection so combining them in a
 * single object takes advantage of this restriction to offer a simpler API.
 * <p>
 * However applications running in a Java SE environment or in the Java EE
 * application client container are permitted to create multiple active sessions
 * on the same connection. This allows the same physical connection to be used
 * in multiple threads simultaneously. Such applications which require multiple
 * sessions to be created on the same connection should use one of the
 * <code>createContext</code> methods on the <code>ConnectionFactory</code> to
 * create the first <code>JMSContext</code> and then use the
 * <code>createContext</code> method on <code>JMSContext</code> to create
 * additional <code>JMSContext</code> objects that use the same connection. All
 * these <code>JMSContext</code> objects are application-managed and must be
 * closed when no longer needed by calling their <code>close</code> method.
 * 
 * @version 2.0
 * @since 2.0
