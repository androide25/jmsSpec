/**
 * A client using the simplified JMS API introduced for JMS 2.0 uses a <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE> 
 * object to receive messages from a destination. A <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE>
 * object is created by passing a <code>Destination</code> object to one of the
 * <code>createConsumer</code> or <code>createDurableConsumer</code> methods on
 * a <code>JMSContext</code>. 
 * <P>
 * A <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE> can be created with a message selector. A
 * message selector allows the client to restrict the messages delivered to the
 * <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE> to those that match the selector.
 * <p>
 * A client may either synchronously receive a <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE>'s 
 * messages or have the <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE> asynchronously deliver them 
 * as they arrive. 
 * <p>
 * For synchronous receipt, a client can request the next message from a 
 * <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE> using one of its <code>receive</code> methods. There are several 
 * variations of <code>receive</code> that allow a client to poll or wait for the next message. 
 * <p>
 * For asynchronous delivery, a client can register a <code>MessageListener</code> object 
 * with a <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE>.
 * As messages arrive at the <CODE>JMSConsumer</CODE>, it delivers them by calling 
 * the <code>MessageListener</code>'s <code>onMessage</code> method.
 * <p>
 * It is a client programming error for a <code>MessageListener</code> to throw an exception.
 * 
 * @version 2.0
