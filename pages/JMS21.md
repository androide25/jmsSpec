## What's going to be in JMS 2.1? 

The initial proposals for JMS 2.1 are summarised in [JSR 368](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=368). This is not intended to be a definitive list. It is expected that new items will be added, and some will be dropped, during the course of the development of the new specification.

The current plan is described in the [JMS 2.1 plan](/jms-spec/pages/JMS21Plan)

A longer list of issues proposed for JMS 2.1 may be found on the [JMS 2.1 planning long list](/jms-spec/pages/JMS21LongList). Each issue is recorded in the [JMS spec issue tracker](https://github.com/javaee/jms-spec/issues). Proposals for new features (or other changes to the specification) are always welcome.
