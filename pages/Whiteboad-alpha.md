=Welcome to the public whiteboad!= 
Anyone can edit this page, please use the wiki syntax quick reference for editing guidance.

What we'd really like to see are three things: ideas, feedback and a better way of hosting a public whiteboard than a wiki page!

Bullet lists are a good way to provide messages to us for now. Could you stick to the following format:
'' year/month/date -- your java.net name -- your message

Thanks,
Nick

* 2012-11-13 --nwright -- I'd like a better whiteboard
* 2012-11-13 --nwright -- and a uniform monitoring API for JMS vendors (but I really need to tie this to the JIRA ticket that exists and make some comments)
* 2013-01-17 --gregorr -- I'd love to see advanced features like '''message segmentation''' (for splitting up large binary messages) and '''message grouping''' (for transparently handling multiple messages that belong to the same context/business case) make it to the JMS standard. Currently these features are only available as proprietary extensions, e.g. in IBM MQ.
