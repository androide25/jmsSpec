# How to join the JSR 343 Expert group

This page describes the steps that need to be followed if you wish to join the JSR 343 Expert Group

<h3>Before you start</h3>

Please note that anyone can participate in JSR 343 without formally joining the expert group. So before you start your application, please join the users@jms-spec.java.net mailing list. You can find some instructions on how to join, and how to browse the online archives, [ http://java.net/projects/jms-spec/pages/Home#Mailing_lists_connected_to_the_jms-spec.java.net_project here] .  Doing so will give you full access to the expert group's deliberations and give you an opportunity to comment on its activities. In addition, please take a look at the draft spec and javadocs by following the links [http://java.net/projects/jms-spec/pages/Home#Latest_draft_specification_and_javadocs here]. You can do all this right now without waiting for any approvals from anyone. 

<h3>Expert group application process</h3>

* Decide whether you are applying to join the expert group as an **individual** or on behalf of an **organisation**. If you're known to be associated with an organisation with an interest in JMS (e.g. your employer is a JMS vendor) then we will expect you to apply to represent that organisation, not as an individual. 

* If you're representing an organisation, that organisation must be a JCP member. The organisation must sign the Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA) and pay the appropriate fee (US$ 5000 for commercial entities,.US$ 2000 for educational or non-profit institutions, US$ 0 for existing licensees). If you're joining as an individual, you must personally sign the Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA); the fee is US$ 0.  For more information on becoming a JCP member, see [http://jcp.org/en/participation/membership]

* Register with the  [http://jcp.org] website if you haven't already done so. To set up an account, use the form at [http://jcp.org/en/user/add]

* If you are applying to join the expert group on behalf of an organisation, then you must associate your jcp account with this organisation. To request to be associated with an existing JCP Member, go to [http://jcp.org] and log in. Then click "My Profile" under "My JCP". This will take you to the "View Profile page where you can review and update your contact information. Near the top of the page is a link labeled "Request Member association". Click this link and fill out the form, selecting the JCP Member which you represent from a list. When the form is submitted, the primary contact of that JCP Member will get a message asking them to confirm your status as an official representative of that Membership.

* Complete and submit the expert group application form at [ http://jcp.org/en/jsr/egnom?id=343]. That's all you need to do initially.

* Your application will then be reviewed by the JCP administrators to determine whether the necessary JSPA agreement is in place. If there is a problem the JCP administrators will contact you. You can contact them at [mailto:admin@jcp.org admin@jcp.org].

* Once your application has been approved by the JCP administrators, the JSR 343 specification lead will consider your application and approve or reject it. 

* **Your application will be made public** Please note that details of your application to join the expert group, including your organizational affiliation, together with the specification lead's official response, and any substantive deliberations within the expert group about the matter, will be published on the expert group mailing list and therefore made public.
