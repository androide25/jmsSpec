# JMS 2.0 Final Release 

JMS 2.0 was finally released on 21 May 2013.

The specification document and API documentation may be downloaded from the JCP website [here](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr343/index.html). 

Since the JMS 2.0 "final release" there has since been an errata release: See [JMS 2.0 errata page](/jms-spec/pages/JMS20RevA).

Browse the API documentation for [http://jms-spec.java.net/2.0/apidocs/index.html JMS 2.0 only] (on jms-spec.java.net) or for [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/ all of Java EE 7] (on docs.oracle.com)

JMS 2.0 was developed by the Java Community Process as [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=343 JSR 343].

## What's new in JMS 2.0? 

A full list of the new features, changes and clarifications introduced in JMS 2.0 is given in the specification. See section B.5 "Version 2.0" of the "Change history" appendix. Here is a summary:

The JMS 2.0 specification now requires JMS providers to implement both P2P and Pub-Sub.

The following new messaging features have been added in JMS 2.0:
* Delivery delay: a message producer can now specify that a message must not be delivered until after a specified time interval.
* New send methods have been added to allow an application to send messages asynchronously.
* JMS providers must now set the JMSXDeliveryCount message property.

The following change has been made to aid scalability:
* Applications are now permitted to create multiple consumers on the same durable or non-durable topic subscription. In previous versions of JMS only a single consumer was permitted.

Several changes have been made to the JMS API to make it simpler and easier to use:
* `Connection`, `Session` and other objects with a `close` method now implement the `java.jang.AutoCloseable` interface to allow them to be used in a Java SE 7 try-with-resources statement. 
* A new "simplified API" has been added which offers a simpler alternative to the standard API, especially in Java EE applications.
* New methods have been added to create a session without the need to supply redundant arguments.
* Although setting client ID remains mandatory when creating an unshared durable subscription, it is optional when creating a shared durable subscription. 
* A new method `getBody` has been added to allow an application to extract the body directly from a Message without the need to cast it first to an appropriate subtype. 

A new chapter has been added which describes some additional restrictions and behaviour which apply when using the JMS API in the Java EE web or EJB container. This information was previously only available in the EJB and Java EE platform specifications. 

A new chapter has been added which defines a number of standard configuration properties for JMS message-driven beans.

New methods have been added to `Session` which return a `MessageConsumer` on a durable topic subscription. Applications could previously only obtain a domain-specific `TopicSubscriber`, even though its use was discouraged. 

The specification has been clarified in various places.

The JMS 2.0 specification was developed by recording each proposed change in a a JIRA issue tracker. Here's a summary page of  [all JIRA issues incorporated into JMS 2.0](/jms-spec/pages/JSR343Planning)

If, having read about JMS 2.0, you have questions about why it was designed as it was, read the [JMS 2.0 design FAQ](/jms-spec/pages/JMS20ReasonsFAQ).

## Reference implementation 

The purpose of a reference implementation is to prove that a specification can be implemented. There are two reference implementations for JMS 2.0.

* The reference implementation for JMS 2.0 in a Java SE environment is based on Open Message Queue 5.0. 
  * [Open Message Queue project page](/openmq)
  * [Open MQ RI downloads page](/openmq/www/downloads/ri/)

* The reference implementation for JMS 2.0 as part of a Java EE 7 application server is based on GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.0 and is available from the [GlassFish project page](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/).

## JMS 2.0 tutorial

The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/partmessaging.htm JMS 2.0 tutorial] (part of the [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/home.htm Java EE 7 tutorial]) introduces the basics of JMS 2.0 and provides some simple examples that you can download and run.

## JMS 2.0 demonstration examples 

A [http://netbeans.org NetBeans] project which demonstrates some of the new features of JMS 2.0 may be downloaded  [http://java.net/projects/jms-spec/downloads/download/JMS20Demo.zip as a zip] or checked out from the project's subversion repository [http://java.net/projects/jms-spec/sources/repository/show/jms2.0/demos/JMS20Demo here]. An earlier version was demonstrated at JavaOne 2012.

This demonstration (which was last updated to work with GlassFish build 82) shows
* Use of the JMS 2.0 simplified API  using application-managed `JMSContext` objects
* Use of the JMS 2.0 API using Java EE container-managed (injected) `JMSContext` objects
* Use of the new `receiveBody` method to synchronously receive a message and return its body in a single method call
* Use of the new `getBody` method to return the body of a `Message` without the need to cast it to a more specific message type

Please report issues with this demonstration directly to [mailto:nigel.deakin@oracle.com Nigel Deakin].
