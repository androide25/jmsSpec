### How to join the conference

We use Zoom for web conferencing. This supports Windows/Mac/iOS/Android and provides video, audio, and screen-sharing. It also supports access by phone as well.

Use the following URL to join the Oracle Zoom Conference: https://oracle.zoom.us/j/779443739?pwd=CzeZ1NH%2BlSY%3D . This provides one click access to the Zoom conference at the scheduled time from a PC, Mac, iOS or Android device. Before joining the conference for the first time, follow that link and download the appropriate client application.

Instead of using the direct link you can go to https://oracle.zoom.us and click "Join Meeting"

You can use your device's microphone and speakers, or you can use a phone. When you join the conference a pop-up dialog (right) asks you to specify which type of audio you are using. 

To use the phone, choose a phone number from the list displayed on the screen. The list of phone numbers is also [https://oracle.zoom.us/zoomconference?m=csCVlRtHCJIAmtQgZGD47bNB2ieUiEdp here]. 
When prompted, enter the meeting ID: 779 443 739

After joining by phone, enter the participant number displayed on that dialog (circled in red in the screenshot on the right) into your telephone. This is used to associate your phone call with your online session (otherwise it looks as if two people are calling in, which is confusing).
